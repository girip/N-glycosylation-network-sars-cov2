# N-glycan biosynthesis network for SARS-CoV-2 spike S protein



# Instructions for using the scripts to generate N-Glycosylation pathway
1. Download GNAT toolbox from http://gnatmatlab.sourceforge.net/
2. Replace the db folder in GNAT/examplefiles/ subfolder. 
3. Install GNAT in matlab. Follow instructions for installing GNAT from the instruction manual.
4. Add path to glycan folder provided in this git.
5. Run infer_from_mspec_covid file from scripts folder. Change the path for using different initial glycans.

To come soon:
- Scripts for visualization of full and blocked N-glycosylation network.

 <!-- 6. To visualize the network, run the visualization.m after running the infer_from_mpsec_covid script. -->
